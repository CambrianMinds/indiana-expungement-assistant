### Detailed Description (Plain text formatted for CWS)
```text
Indiana Expungement Assistant is a free, independent self-help legal document generator designed to help Hoosiers reclaim their second chance under Indiana's Second Chance Law (Indiana Code § 35-38-9).

Indiana law permits eligible individuals to expunge conviction and non-conviction records, removing barriers to employment, professional licensing, and housing. However, the legal paperwork can be daunting, and hiring private counsel often costs thousands of dollars. This extension automates the discovery, eligibility analysis, and formal document formatting for pro se (self-represented) petitioners.

KEY FEATURES
• Automated MyCase Record Extraction: Reads case numbers, charge descriptions, filing dates, disposition details, and court codes directly from Indiana MyCase search results.
• Statutory Eligibility Analysis: Evaluates records against IC § 35-38-9 tiers (Arrests/Dismissals, Misdemeanors, Level 6 Felonies, and Major Felonies).
• Waiting Period Calculations: Automatically calculates required statutory waiting periods from arrest or disposition date.
• Lifetime One-Shot Rule Protection: Enforces strict statutory warnings under IC § 35-38-9-9(i), preventing irreversible omissions before filing.
• Complete In-Browser Court Pleadings: Uses client-side PDF generation (pdf-lib) directly inside the browser to compile court-ready pro se pleadings (including Appearance Form, Notice of Exclusion of Confidential Information, Confidential Information Sheet ACR Form, and Verified Petition) with zero server dependencies or local software setup.

HOW TO USE
1. Navigate to Indiana MyCase (public.courts.in.gov/mycase) in Google Chrome.
2. Search for all cases under your legal name, previous names, maiden names, and aliases across all Indiana counties.
3. Open the Indiana Expungement Assistant side panel.
4. Click "Scan Page & Check Eligibility" to analyze your charges.
5. Complete your Petitioner Profile in the Profile tab (stored locally only).
6. Acknowledge the statutory legal disclaimers and one-shot rule.
7. Click "Generate Complete Petition Packet" to download your filing package immediately.

PRIVACY & DATA SECURITY GUARANTEE
• 100% In-Browser Execution: All case analysis and document generation happen entirely on your computer inside the browser session.
• Zero Cloud Storage: Your Social Security Number, Date of Birth, addresses, and criminal history are NEVER transmitted to external servers, cloud databases, or third parties.
• Transparent & Open Source: Auditable codebase licensed under the MIT License.

This tool is a clerical document preparation assistant and does not provide legal advice, legal counsel, or case representation.
